Sample Text Document

This is a sample text document for testing the document processing pipeline.
It contains multiple paragraphs to demonstrate text extraction and chunking.

Introduction
------------
The document processing system handles various file formats including PDF,
DOCX, TXT, and Markdown files. It extracts text, metadata, and structure
from these documents.

Features
--------
- Automatic format detection
- Text extraction with encoding handling
- Metadata extraction (file size, word count, etc.)
- Text chunking for RAG systems
- Structure detection for Markdown

Technical Details
-----------------
The text parser uses UTF-8 encoding by default with fallback to latin-1
for compatibility. It normalizes Unicode characters and whitespace to
ensure consistent processing.

Chunking is performed using word-based approximation with configurable
chunk size and overlap. This enables efficient retrieval in RAG systems.

Conclusion
----------
This sample document demonstrates the capabilities of the text processing
system. It can handle plain text files with various content types and
structures.

Additional paragraphs provide more content for testing chunking algorithms.
The system should split this document into multiple chunks based on the
configured chunk size and overlap settings.
